In order to run bat files and the genereated makefile you must set up a msvc x64 build environment.
To do so Run: "vcvarsall.bat x64"
This file can usually be found on windows under: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build>"
Alternativly search for: "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" to open a terminal with the build environment enabled.
